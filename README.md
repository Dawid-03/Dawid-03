# Dawid Szewczyk

Hey! I'm Dawid ‚Äì an 19-year-old backend developer building real-world apps that actually work.  

I'm focused on building reliable, scalable APIs, using tools like Go, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Kafka.
I love designing backend systems from scratch, thinking about structure, performance, and developer experience.
